# Android Craps Simulator


![Craps Screen Capture](Craps.png)


Allows the user to play a single game of craps or to run a simulation of
Monte Carlo style that will continue to run indefinitely as long as the 
user has the run button deployed.

The application projects images of dice faces depending on the rolls
given and displays the sum of each roll. If the final roll is a win
the application will output a green color to signify win and a red 
color to signify a loss.

A tally at the bottom of the screen displays total wins divided by
total plays to output the percentage of the wins against losses.

The buttons are play for a single play. The run button if activated
will deploy and play indefinitely until engaged again. Reset allows the
user to clear the current tally and the dice in the display from the last
play.
